written in C and compiled using GCC, with assistance of CodeLite IDE.

In linux, to start the program, go into the /BranchPredictin/Debug subfolder, 
open a terminal there, and type ./BranchPrediction.
The program will then run and display the simulation results for static predictor,
PAp, GAp, and then GShare.
